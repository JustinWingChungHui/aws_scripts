# aws_scripts

I use AWS for work, and I've written a lot of helper scripts to automate tasks.
This repo is public so that other people can pick through them, potentially use them for their own work or reuse bits of code I've written.

The scripts are organised on a per-service basis: one folder per service.
There's a docstring or comment at the top of each script that explains what it's meant to do, and a bit of the context.

## Usage

Download the script from the repo, run it locally.

I routinely use Python 3.6 or newer, and a copy of [boto3](https://pypi.org/project/boto3/), the AWS SDK for Python.
Some scripts include other dependencies -- look at the imports.
